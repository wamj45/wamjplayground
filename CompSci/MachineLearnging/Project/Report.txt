                                    Project Report

Objective:
   Utilize the [enter algorithm] in order to predict the winner of the next UEFA
Champions League Final based on this years tournament's results. ESPNS'
SPI Global Rankings were used due to it providing a strength level for each team's
defense and offense. According to ESPN's website "SPI is forward-looking and predictive".
This statement was the driving force for attempting this project.


Dataset:
   The dataset used can be found at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jpmiller/global-club-soccer-ratings?select=spi_global_rankings_intl.csv

Methodology:
   Dataset needed to be adjusted for this use case. An "*" was added to each Champions League
qualifying team. Group letter was added to each team for quick sorting of the groups.
Predicted winner of each match should take into account SPI, offensive, and defensive
rankings. The sum of these values will be compared to the opponent's values. The larger
of the two should, indicate winner. This will be tested against true results.
