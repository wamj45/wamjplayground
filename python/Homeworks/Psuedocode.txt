# Algorithm:
#   Prompt user to enter the directory to search for images
#   call ImageEvaluator
#       Initialize values/variables to be used throughout the program
#       pass in user input as path
#       verify the path the program is running in is the same path containing images
#       if not change to the correct directory containing the images
#       Start
#           search for images of all types within path and append them to a list
#           Iterate through the list and calculate luminance for each image,
#               return relative luminance
#           Iterate through the image list once more and calculate the brightness of each image
#               return precieved brightness
#           Load data into dictiunary
#           Convert dictionary to JSON file and write to file in the directory
#       End
