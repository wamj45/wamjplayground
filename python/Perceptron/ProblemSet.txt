  a. X:[medical history, symptoms], y:[problem], f:[Diagnoses]
  b. X:[handwritten examples], y:[handwritten answer], f:[digit recognizer]
  c. X:[emails, spam emails], y:[good, spam], f:[email]->[good, spam]
  d. X:[historical data composed of price, temp, dayOfWeek], y:[electrical load], f:[future load]
  e. Problem PID Tuner Controller. For a PID Controller you need the values of
      Proportional, Intergral, and Derivative Gains. You want a target value, say temperature,
      you input the target temperature and P,I,D values for your system into the controller and
      the output of the controller will be something like voltage/power you need set your system
      to in order to maintain your target temperature based on current temp. Assuming we use similar systems.
      X:[Dataset of predetermined working temps] y:[P, I, D values used on those systems] f:[P,I,D for your system]

  a. Supervised. We would use the users past data to get a prediction of what books
      she/he likes and make recommendations on future books.
  b. We would use Reinforcement training in this case.
  c. We could use Unsupervised training in this case. We don't care about the categories.
      But we want them to be grouped in some form. We can then transition to Supervised to
      correctly identify/label the groups.
  d. Reinforcement. We use a dataset of musical notes. And reward when notes are played in a
      certain arrangment.
  e. Here we would use a Supervised learning system. We would use past data to predict
      if a maximum credit limit.
